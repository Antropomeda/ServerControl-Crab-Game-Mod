A powerful plugin for complete server control in Crab Game. It provides advanced administration tools, gameplay management, and the creation of unique game scenarios

Moderation and Security:


The plugin includes a complete player management system. Kicks, temporary and permanent bans, and a warning system are available. A customizable Auto-Ban feature is implemented, triggered when the warning limit is reached. A whitelist protects specific players from mass actions and bans. Nametags can be enabled, allowing you to see player locations and nicknames through obstacles


Gameplay Management:


Antro Server Control allows you to manage your lobby without restarting the server. Force game starts, round endings, and return to the lobby are available. Maps and game modes are selected through the menu and are applied instantly. You can also change the round timer and global gravity (for example, Moon Gravity mode)


Interacting with Players:


The tools include granting any weapon or item to a specific player or to everyone on the server. The Fake Chat feature allows you to send chat messages impersonating other players. Adjustable punch strength (Chaos Punch), and mass actions: kill everyone, teleport everyone to your location, freeze players, or shuffle their positions


Scripting System:


The mod has its own built-in script interpreter for event automation. It supports variables, mathematical operations, conditional statements (IF/THEN), loops, and labels. Scripts can be written and edited directly in-game, and presets can be saved and loaded. The interface includes documentation on syntax and available commands


Usage:


The control menu is opened by pressing F10. When the interface is open, character controls are locked for ease of navigation, and a cursor appears. All key security and gameplay parameters are configured in the Settings tab


Note:

!!!!There are no beautiful visuals yet, and there aren't any plans for them in the next few versions, as I'll be working on bugs and functionality!!!!


!!!!The mod is currently in testing (especially the ban/tempban and unban systems), so there may be some bugs. If you find any, record a video, then send it to me on Discord and explain what happened. (You can also post ideas for improvement (what new things can be added))!!!!
